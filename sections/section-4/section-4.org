* TODO TODO

- After OSM update (already happened) (might've already done some of these, check):
  - terrible track just west of Pisgah Hill (Natchaug Forest)
  - Natchaug orange trail power line trail off of Fayette Wright rd instead of continuing on rd (a bit south of the above)
  - instead of turning from morey to marcy (bottom, almost at airline), route onto twisting track (orange trail), leading eventually to nutmeg lane, then airline
  - Consider routing onto the twisting trail right above that too ^
