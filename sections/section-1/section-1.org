* TODO TODO

- Smoothest path down from West Rock? All the way almost down to Brooks Rd, or half-way down (as it is now)?
- After OSM update on 2021-08-20:
  - wait for Blake st exit from footway (from parking lot adjacent), and also entrance to footway (at city)
  - route onto rough track (then, compacted road) near center of Roxbury — Rocky Mountain Road…cuts off angled notch
  - download again for surface info
