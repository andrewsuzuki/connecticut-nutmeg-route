* Decisions/Notes

- From Nepaug State Forest to the Nepaug Reservoir/Dam
  - TODO Can either follow Satan's Kingdom Road all the way to the main entrance,
    or take the other gravel road to the other entrance closer to the dam,
    which actually seems to be outside the Nepaug State Forest, but is marked on the trail map as a gravel road.
- Farmington River Trail
- TODO consider a reroute going much farther south towards Farmington center and then back up through the West Hartford Reservoirs Area
- Werner's Woods?
  - I don't see any Strava activity, and the entrance from Lawton Road doesn't seem to exist on streetside?
- Simsbury Land Trust -- biking is prohibitied except where noted
  - Tanager Hill would have been convenient
- Penwood State Park?
  - Weird, on ctparks.org it has multiple photos of people mountain biking, yet on the trail map it says all trails are foot-only?
- Skirting around Bradley airport seems like the best option (don't have to go on major roads)
- In the center of Windsor Locks, looks like they closed down the end of Church St and are making it more pedestrian friendly.
  TODO update route when construction finishes.
- Windsor Locks Canal State Park Trail seems nice
- Enfield multi-use trail along Town Farm Road will be 2mi paved, but won't be completed for a couple more years (2026?)
- Shenipsit State Forest
  - Soapstone Mountain climb
    - TODO where's the best overlook?
  - TODO is Old Country Road rideable and legal?
- Doesn't look like Breakneck Hill Road (for entering Nipmuck, from MA) is public
- Nipmuck Trail in Yale-Myers Forest: sign says foot travel only
- Nipmuck State Forest
  - "The Blue Blazed Nipmuck Trail is foot travel only.
    Other trails at Bigelow Hollow State Park & Nipmuck State Forest
    are multi-use non-motorized (except snowmobile)."
